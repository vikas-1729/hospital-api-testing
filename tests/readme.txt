// for doing testing what i have done is make different module
//so it has three module
// doctors,reports,patients
// now in each module which  routes are possible fro, that for example from doctors
//we can use doctor/register,doctor/login
//so in that module i have test both these
//now in doing testing  i am considering all possible and test for it 
for example for doctor register
// we have three cases
1. it register succesfully
2. it username is taken
3. internal server error
now for each testcase i make my assert and compare with it
